    <h2>Origin</h2>
    <div class = txtbox>
    This project was meant to be a tribute to pre-4.0 Tokyo 7th Sisters game.
    <br>
    I was moved by the music of this game so I decided that, on their 5th Anniversary I'd 
    make a game based on the roots of what's t7s was.
    <br>
    This is sadly all I could do.

        osu-parser library was used to convert .osu files to a format compatible with this game.
